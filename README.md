# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is an early-stage research prototype exploring wearable vision assistance for blind and visually impaired users. The goal of the project is to investigate hardware and system design choices for real-time, audio-based guidance using a head-worn camera.

This repository currently contains planning documents, hardware exploration, and an initial software scaffold. The focus at this stage is on building a functional prototype and understanding performance and usability tradeoffs rather than a polished product.
