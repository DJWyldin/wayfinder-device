# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is a work-in-progress project exploring how a wearable camera and audio feedback could be used to help visually impaired users navigate their surroundings. This project is being developed as part of an academic collaboration and is focused on learning and experimentation.

Right now, the repository mainly includes planning notes, hardware ideas, and early setup for a prototype. The goal at this stage is to better understand the hardware and system tradeoffs before building a full working version.
